# Colour_Wheel

My project, **Color Wheel Visualization Tool** integrated Python programming, image processing, and data visualization to produce a dynamic and interesting application. With an image preprocessing function that maintains aspect ratios for visually appealing photos as its starting point, this project demonstrates my capacity to combine technical and creative skills. I precisely extracted and measured dominating colors from input photos using the extcolors library. Then, using key pictures to improve aesthetics and context, the program created interactive color wheel visualizations that graphically depicted dominating color codes and their related percentages. Automation was a top goal because it made saving visualizations as image files simple. This project highlights my Python knowledge, attention to image processing minutiae, and ability to produce visually appealing data visualizations.
